        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <span>
          At Genesis EdTech, we are passionate about transforming education in
          Africa through STEM — Science, Technology, Engineering, and
          Mathematics. We believe that every child deserves access to
          future-ready skills, no matter their background.
        </span>

        <h3>What We Do</h3>
        <span>
          We design and deliver engaging, hands-on learning experiences in
          robotics, coding, 3D design, and more. Our team works with schools,
          educators, and communities to make STEM education practical, fun, and
          meaningful. Whether it's through after-school clubs, teacher training,
          or digital tools, Genesis is here to ignite curiosity and build
          confidence in young innovators.
        </span>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <span>
          The world is changing fast. At Genesis, we're making sure our students
          aren't just keeping up — they're leading. By equipping learners with
          the tools to solve real-world problems, we're preparing a generation
          of thinkers, makers, and leaders.
